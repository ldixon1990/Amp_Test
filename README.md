# Amp_Test

To run the postman script ensure variables are setup as:
VARIABLE         INITIAL VALUE         CURRENT VALUE
Userid           6wl                   6wl
name             Gregory Loscombe      Gregory Loscombe
id               15330                 15330
location         Manchester            Manchester
public_repos     7                     7
public_gists     11                    11
followers        12                    12
following        29                    29

Ensure the URL is formatted with the {{}} around Userid so we know this is a variable and can change per test.
